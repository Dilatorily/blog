# Dabbling in Electron

JavaScript is everywhere. Even though it has a history of polarizing developers, we can not deny the large impact that it has on the current technology ecosystem. This ecosystem has sparked multiple interesting projects, one of which is [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

Electron is a framework to build cross platform applications with the current web technologies. This means that a web developer can create a great desktop application that can work on virtually any desktops, without having to learn multiple languages or different technology ecosystems.

As for myself, I will experiment with the framework to create a music player that will manage my music library, with a few more features down the road. Let's begin!

---

To start our project, we first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Node is an open-source runtime environment to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. The Javascript engine is powered by Google Chrome's JavaScript engine, [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8). Node comes with its own package manager, [NPM](https://github.com/npm/npm), that has clear inspirations from [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org).

To install Node.js on Windows machines, you will need to execute the *MSI* file, while on Apple machines you should execute the *PKG* file. They are available for download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current). Finally, on Unix machines, you can run the following command instead to install Node.js.

```shell
$ curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```
---

Once Node.js is installed, the next step is to create a `package.json` file in our project folder. The `package.json` file is a great place to store all the metadata about your project. Indeed, it can store the information about the project's name, version, author, license, and repository. All that information is stored, and it can be made publicly available through the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) repositories.

To initialize the `package.json` file, you can type the following command, and follow the instructions.

```shell
$ npm init
```

After a few questions, you should have a `package.json` that look like the following file. Do not worry if your file does not correspond to what I have, since we will be customizing it shortly.

```json
{
  "name": "agate",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Electron-based music player",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/Dilatorily/agate.git"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "Electron",
    "React",
    "Redux",
    "Music"
  ],
  "author": "Dilatorily",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/Dilatorily/agate/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/Dilatorily/agate#readme"
}
```

The only required fields in the file are the project's `name` and `version`. Also note that NPM uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) as its versioning scheme for its packages. For more information on the `package.json` format, read the [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json) page. It should describe every field and their purpose.

As we are dealing with rather new technologies, let's also use the latest version of JavaScript. JavaScript, much like other languages such as Java, has a specification that describes the language, that is completely separate from its implementation. As such, the JavaScript specifications, [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm), was updated in June 2015 to its 6<sup>th</sup> edition. The new set of specifications, also known as *ES2015*, adds multiple new [features](http://git.io/es6features) to the language, but they are not currently [supported](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6) by all browsers. A smaller update, known as *ES2016*, was released earlier this year in June 2016.

Since the current JavaScript engines do not all support all of the features from ES2015, we can use a *transpiler* to use the JavaScript of tomorrow, today. A transpiler is a program that translate the source code from a language into source code of another language. The transpiler that we will use is [Babel](https://babeljs.io), since it also supports other features that we will be using. To install Babel in our project, we can run the following command.

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev babel-cli
```

In the command above we are telling NPM to install the `babel-cli` package in our project. The `--save-dev` argument tells NPM to add the dependency in the `devDependencies` field of out `package.json` file. Finally, the `babel-cli` package is the command line interface to interact with Babel. We can also use some shortcuts to save some keystroke. `install` can be reduced to `i` and `--save-dev` to `-D`. Using those shortcuts, we can rewrite the command above into the following one.

```shell
$ npm i -D babel-cli
```

Even though we installed Babel, we must configure it to transpile ES2016. Fortunately for us, Babel has presets that lets us use the features from ES2015 and ES2016. To configure Babel, we must add a `.babelrc` file in our project. The contents of that file should be the same as the following one.

```json
{
  "presets": ["es2015", "es2016"]
}
```

We also need to install the presets using the following command.

```shell
$ npm i -D babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-es2016
```

Finally, to use Babel in our project we can run the following command. That command will transpile all files from the `src` folder and put the results in the `dist` folder.

```shell
$ ./node_modules/.bin/babel src -d dist
```

---

Now that we have most of our dependencies, let's play with Electron! First we need to import the Electron dependency in our project. Again, we will install it using NPM.

```shell
$ npm i --save electron-prebuilt
```

This time we are saving the dependency in the `dependencies` field of the `package.json`, since our application will have a direct dependency to the Electron binaries. We can also use the `-S` shorthand instead of `--save` to save a few keystrokes.

A great feature of Electron is that we can use HTML markup to describe our application's layout. As such, let's create an `index.html` file in the `src` folder that will be used in our application.

```shell
$ mkdir src
$ touch src/index.html
```

To start, the contents of the `index.html` file can be as simple as the following snippet.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Agate</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

We should also create an entry point to start our application. For that we will be creating an `index.js` in the `src` folder with the following command.

```shell
$ touch src/index.js
```

The content of a simple application is given in the snippet below. The comments were added to explain a few details.

```javascript
// app controls the application's lifecycle
// BrowserWindow creates native windows
import { app, BrowserWindow } from 'electron';
import { join } from 'path';

// We must keep a reference of the main window, or the JavaScript's
// garbage collector will remove it and close the window.
let mainWindow;

const createWindow = () => {
    mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 });
    mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${ join(__dirname, 'index.html') }`);

    // We are listening to the 'closed' event. It is emitted when a
    // window is closed.
    mainWindow.on('closed', () => {
        mainWindow = null;
    });
};

// We are listening to the 'ready' event. Electron will emit this event
// once it is ready to create windows.
app.on('ready', createWindow);

// The 'window-all-closed' event is emitted when all of the Electron
// windows are closed.
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
    // On macOS, applications stay open until the user quits explicitely
    // with the Cmd + Q keystroke
    if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
        app.quit();
    }
});

// On macOS, the application stays on the dock tray when the windows are
// closed. This listener is to re-create a window when it is clicked on,
// and there are no windows open.
app.on('activate', () => {
    if (mainWindow === null) {
        createWindow();
    }
});
```

Now, to try out Electron, all we need to do is run the following commands.

```shell
$ rm -rf dist
$ ./node_modules/.bin/babel src -d dist
$ cp src/index.html dist
$ ./node_modules/.bin/electron dist
```

You should be now be able to see a window with `Hello, World!`.

To help us with developing our project, we can use some NPM scripts that will take care of the various tasks related to building and running our application. We will create 3 main tasks to help us with our project.

1. `npm run build` will apply Babel from our `src` folder and it will put the results in the `dist` folder.
2. `npm start` will start the Electron process.
3. `npm run clean` will delete the `dist` folder.

Also, to help us with automation, we will create [pre-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). A pre-script is a command that is executed right before the actual command is run. For example, we want to `build` our application before we try to `start` it. So we can write a pre-script for `start`, named `prestart`, that will call `npm run build`.

In the same way, we will create a pre-script for `build` that will call `npm run clean`. This will ensure that we are not using an old build when we start our application. To help us with delete folders, we will be using the `rimraf` module to delete folders recursively in a cross-platform compatible way.

```shell
$ npm i -D rimraf
```

All of those scripts are located in your `package.json` under the `scripts` attribute. You should have something like the following snippet. *Note* that in NPM scripts, the `./node_modules/.bin` path is added to the `$PATH` environment variable, such that we can omit that part from our scripts.

```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rimraf dist",
  "prebuild": "npm run clean",
  "build": "babel src -d dist && cp src/index.html dist",
  "prestart": "npm run build",
  "start": "electron dist"
}
```

Now that your scripts are created, you can simply run a single command to start your updated application!

```shell
$ npm start
```

As we have seen in today's post, the barrier of entry to create a cross-platform desktop application has been lowered with the emergence of the Electron framework. I will continue my next post by adding [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) in the project.

The code created in this post is available [here](https://github.com/Dilatorily/agate/tree/2016-07-18).
